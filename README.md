I coded these tools in python and php just to automate my work and reduce my time.
CMScnnaer.py is a python code which crawls the site and then verify the presemce of default files in the so obtained links.
presently this scanner can identify Joomla, Wordpress, Drupal, ColdFusion, Silverstripe, Fatwire, Sharepoint,
Vignette.
